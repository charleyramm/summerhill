summerhill
==========

Summerhill Wordpress theme based on designs by Sam Horwood and sadly uncompleted after my hard drive crashed last summer (2012).

I spent a few hours today making first an HTML verstion and now a Wordpress theme based on Sam's design and I am making this available for free under a GPL2 license.

I would enjoy it if anybody with the appropriate skills would like to collaborate on this project. I hope I have provided a suitable starting point. 

There is a live demo at http://charleyramm.co.uk/summerhillschool.co.uk/wordpress.

Code quality
------------
The live demo is running the _Theme Unit Test_ demo content which provides common scenarios that break Wordpress themes. The ultimate aim is to pass the Wordpress.org theme review process, and thereby provide a website management system for the School that will be easy to manage and difficult to break. 

I have favoured browser compatibility and ease of use over advanced features. HTML5 was dropped early on because it is incompatible with older browsers. Ditto carousel slideshow animations.

Ease of use
-----------
I hope that somebody with poor to intermediate tech skills will be able to update the website without difficulty.

To do
-----
Create a sidebar widget that populates the right hand sidebar with interesting Summerhill quotes. Possibly using Wordpress custom post fields, falling back on quotes chosen at random from a text based list.
