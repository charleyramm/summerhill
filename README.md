summerhill
==========

Summerhill Wordpress theme based on designs by Sam Horwood and sadly uncompleted after my hard drive crashed last summer (2012).

I spent a few hours today making first an HTML verstion and now a Wordpress theme based on Sam's design and I am making this available for free under a GPL2 license.

I would enjoy it if anybody with the appropriate skills would like to collaborate on this project. I hope I have provided a suitable starting point. 

There is a live demo at http://charleyramm.co.uk/summerhillschool.co.uk/wordpress.
